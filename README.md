# ðŸŒ± Smart Agriculture: CNN-Based Potato Disease Detection System

## Introduction

Potatoes are one of the worldâ€™s most significant crops, but their production is threatened by various diseases, leading to yield losses and economic damage for farmers. The major diseases affecting potatoes include:

- **Early Blight**  
  Caused by *Alternaria solani*, early blight results in dark spots on leaves and stems, reducing photosynthesis and leading to lower yields.

- **Late Blight**  
  Caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, late blight is the disease responsible for the historical Irish potato famine. It spreads rapidly, causing dark lesions on leaves, stems, and tubers, eventually rotting the entire plant.

- **Healthy**  
  Indicates leaves or plants free from visible symptoms of disease.

## Problem Statement

Early detection of potato diseases is crucial to prevent large-scale crop losses. However, manual inspection is time-consuming and prone to human error. An automated image classification system can help farmers identify diseases quickly and accurately.

## Solution Overview

This project proposes a **deep learning model** using a **Dual-Branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with an **attention mechanism** to detect potato leaf diseases from images.

Key benefits:

- High accuracy in disease classification
- Faster than manual inspection
- Scalable to large agricultural fields

## Model Architecture

The proposed architecture:

- Dual-Branch CNN:
  - Branch 1: Standard feature extraction
  - Branch 2: Attention mechanism for focusing on important regions
- Merged features from both branches
- Dense layers for final classification

---

## Results
  - The model achieved *99%* training accuracy and *97%* validation accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

  - Confusion matrix shows that the model was able to genealize well and able to identify the diseased(Late bright or early bright) and the healthy.
